# Managing Stress & Coping Mechanisms


## Growth Mindset Check-In

### Reflection (5 min)

* When have you been challenged by growth mindset in the last week?
* In what ways has growth mindset helped you this week?
* What do you need to be even more successful with growth mindset?

### Small Group Discussion (5 min)

Share with a group of three your responses to the reflection questions.

## Reflection - Stress Management (5 min)

* How have you balanced stress in past experiences?
* In the past, what has gone well for you when dealing with stressful situations?
* In the past, what has not gone so well when dealing with stressful situations?

## [Common] Ways to Respond to Stress (10 min)

There are four common ways to respond to stress: attack others, attack self, avoidance, and withdrawal. If we think of these responses on a coordinate plane (draw on board), the edges of the axis are when we've hit our maximum. 

Throw out these questions to the group and write examples on board:
* What are some examples of attack others?
* What are some examples of attacking self?
* What are some examples of avoidance?
* What are some examples of withdrawal?

These are the extremes. We use "off-ramps" to help manage our stress before we get to these extremes. If we're on the verge of attacking self or avoidance, what are some things we could do before we hit that point? 

The more we actively practice these "off-ramps", the stronger the neurological connections in our brain become and it makes it easier for us to respond with these "off-ramps" rather than hitting the extreme.

## Small Group Discussion (15 min)

* What's your most common response to stress (using the framework above or not)?
* What are some common "off-ramps" that you find helpful?
* What are some "off-ramps" that maybe weren't as helpful?

Small groups will list their "off-ramps" on a piece of chart paper. 

## Action Planning (10 min)

Students will create an action plan for the last half of the module. Students will first walk around the room to look at other groups' list of "off-ramps" to get ideas.
