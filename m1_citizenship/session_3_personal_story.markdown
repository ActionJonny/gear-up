# Personal Stories & Connection

### (5 minutes) Framing: Why are you here, connection, telling your story

### (10 minutes) Individual Reflection

Students will write in their notebooks and reflect on the following questions:
* What brought you here?  
* What are the values that drive you?
* How do you think you demonstrate those values to people around you? (Could other people identify your values from your actions/words/presence? Why or why not?)

### (20 minutes) Small Group Discussion

Students will get into groups of four (mixed programs) and discuss key takeaways from their individual reflection. Each group member should get 3 minutes to talk (uninterupted about the first two reflection questions). Then, the group should discuss the last question together.

* Facilitator (be sure to keep the conversation flowing, make sure all voice are heard, etc.)
* Notekeeper (take notes in a group DM on Slack so that everyone in the group has access to the notes)
* Timekeeper (allot 5ish minutes to each question)

### (15 minutes) Discussion

* What are the ways that you could bring your unique values, perspective, skills into a team in order to make it even better?
* What could be challenges (or what are challenges you have already faced) when entering a new team?
