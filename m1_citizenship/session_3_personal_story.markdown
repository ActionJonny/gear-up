# Personal Stories & Connection

### (5 minutes) Framing: Why are you here, connection, telling your story

### (10 minutes) Individual Reflection

Students will write in their notebooks and reflect on the following questions:
* What brought you here?  
* What are the values that drive you?
* How do you think you demonstrate those values to people around you?
* Could other people identify your values from your actions/words/presence? Why or why not?

### (15 minutes) Small Group Share

Students will get into groups of four and discuss key takeaways from their individual reflection. Each group member should get 3 minutes to talk (uninterupted about the first two reflection questions). Assign someone to keep time.

### (10 minutes) Small Group Discussion

Assign the following roles:

* Facilitator (be sure to keep the conversation flowing, make sure all voice are heard, etc.)
* Notekeeper (take notes in a group DM on Slack so that everyone in the group has access to the notes)
* Timekeeper (allot 5ish minutes to each question)
* Presenter (present during whole group share)

Discuss the following questions from individual reflection:

* How do you think you demonstrate those values to people around you?
* Could other people identify your values from your actions/words/presence? Why or why not?
* What values are similar/different?
* How do you think these differences/similarites will impact your cohort?

### (15 minutes) Whole Group Share

Each groups's presenter shares their groups discussion of "How do you think these differences/similarites will impact your cohort?" 

Revisit cohort norms. Is there anything the cohort wants to add to this list?
