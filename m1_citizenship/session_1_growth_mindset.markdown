# Turing Citizenship #1: Growth Mindset

## Pre Reading 

"[What Having a Growth Mindset Actually Means](https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means)"

## Mission Alignment
*Our mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.*

## Learning Goals
Today's session will be focused on developing a vision for cohort culture. Students will:

* Learn what a "growth mindset" is and how it will help them succeed at Turing and in the tech industry
* Identify individual strategies to deal with stresses that trigger a "fixed mindset"
* Identify group strategies for supporting each others' growth mindset

By the end of the session, students will have a clear understanding of the individual choices and behavior that can help them develop/maintain a growth mindset in the midst of Turing's pressures.  

## Intro (5 min)
Faciliators review the Gear Up overview and goals for the session

## What is a Growth Mindset? (15 min)
Together, we will watch growth-mindset expert Carol Dweck's TED Talk, "[The Power of Believing that You Can Improve](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve)."

## Individual Reflection (5 min)
In notebooks, reflect on the following questions.
  * How do you think past experiences or experiences this week that have encouraged growth or fixed mindsets?
  * What are your triggers, what's likely to move you to fixed mindset?
  * What can you peers do to support you staying in the growth mindset?

## Small Group Discussion (10 min)
In groups of 3, identify a timekeeper, a faciliator, and a notetaker.  Each student should spend about 2 minutes sharing what surfaced during their writing.

After individual sharing, the groups together should tackle the question: how can you support each other in creating a cohort culture that supports growth mindset. You might draw on Dweck's suggestions from the article you read.

Take notes and assign someone to report out for your group in cohort retro later today.

## Panel Discussion (20 min)
Alumni, instructors, and students will discuss why growth mindset is critical to success at Turing and how growth mindset connects to Turing's mission.

### Questions for the panel:
* What was your greatest challenge in maintaining a growth mindset at Turing?
* What were some of the emotions or feelings you experienced when you were at your most challenging point?
* How did those experiences impact your idea of success at Turing?
* Think back to module 1. If you had known then what you know now, what would you change or do differently?

## Report Out at Group Retro this afternoon
Each small group will report out on what they discussed in small groups.

## Survey Questions
* What value would you assign to this session (from 1-5)?
* What are you taking away from this session?
* How do you think this session will change your approach to your time at Turing and in the tech industry?
