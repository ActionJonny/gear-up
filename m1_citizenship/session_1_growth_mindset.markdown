# Turing Citizenship #1: Growth Mindset

## Mission Alignment
*Our mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.*

Many students describe Turing as one of the most challenging experiences of their lives. On top of new material and a heavy workload, Turing requires you to learn in new ways, get comfortable with the discomfort of not always knowing where to start, and fail repeatedly as part of the frustrating, utterly delightful process of learning.

In order to fulfill Turing's mission, we make concerted effort to help students develop and practice the mindsets we know they'll need to be successful in this setting and the field: growth, engagement, agency, empathy, and grit. Our curriculum and instructional support advance this goal, but that alone is not enough to impart these ways of thinking.

One of the most important features of our community is our culture of mutual support, curiosity, and love of challenge. In their first module at Turing, students will reap the benefits of this culture; this is also when we expect them to begin contributing to it. With a combination of group work, pairings, agile processes, and activities like today's, M1 students are given tools and time to build strong and positive relationships with classmates built on mutual support, encouragement, and accountability.

Over four sessions, students will have an opportunity to connect and organize around the values and goals that brought them to Turing.

  1. **Growth Mindset:** Explore growth mindset and how it will help you succeed at Turing and in the field
  2. **Cohort Vision:** Clarify the values driving your cohort and envision what cohort culture looks, sounds, and feels like
  3. **Public Narrative:** Practice and refine the narratives around which you can build relationships and establish an identity in the field
  4. **Retrospective:** Reflect on what worked and what to build on

Together, these four sessions will help students create a culture of mutual support within their cohort and identify how to tackle challenges with empathy and agility.  

#### Goals
Today's session will be focused on developing a vision for cohort culture. Students will:

* Learn what a "growth mindset" is and how it will help them succeed at Turing and in the tech industry
* Identify individual strategies to deal with stresses that trigger a "fixed mindset"
* Identify group strategies for supporting each others' growth mindset

By the end of the session, students will have a clear understanding of the individual choices and behavior that can help them develop/maintain a growth mindset in the midst of Turing's pressures.  

Pre Reading "[What Having a Growth Mindset Actually Means](https://hbr.org/2016/01/what_having_a_growth_mindset_actually_means)"
## Intro (5 min)
Faciliators review the Gear Up overview and goals for the session

## What is a Growth Mindset? (15 min)
Together, we will watch growth-mindset expert Carol Dweck's TED Talk, "[The Power of Believing that You Can Improve](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve)."

## Individual Reflection (5 min)
In notebooks, reflect on the following questions.
  * How do you think past experiences or experiences this week that have encouraged growth or fixed mindsets?
  * What are your triggers, what's likely to move you to fixed mindset?
  * What can you peers do to support you staying in the growth mindset?

## Small Group Discussion (10 min)
In groups of 3, identify a timekeeper, a faciliator, and a notetaker.  Each student should spend about 2 minutes sharing what surfaced during their writing.

After individual sharing, the groups together should tackle the question: how can you support each other in creating a cohort culture that supports growth mindset. You might draw on Dweck's suggestions from the article you read.

Take notes and assign someone to report out for your group in cohort retro later today.

## Panel Discussion (20 min)
Alumni, Turing leadership, instructors, and students will discuss why growth mindset is critical to success at Turing and how growth mindset connects to Turing's mission.

## Report Out at Group Retro this afternoon
Each small group will report out on what they discussed in small groups.
