### Working Styles & Preferences (5 minutes)

Students will line up on a spectrum of extroversion and introversion. Facilitators will then form groups of 3-4 based on students' self-indentification on the spectrum.

### Small Group Discussion # 1 (15 minutes)

Before you begin discussing the questions below, ensure that the following roles are delegated to members of your group.

| Role | Description |
|--------|-----------|
| **Timekeeper** | Ensure that the group has a chance to address all the discussion questions and time at the end to complete the survey.|
| **Facilitator** | Works with the timekeeper to move through the discussion questions. Solicits input from all members of the group and helps individuals be aware if they are dominating the conversation.|

Students will discuss these questions:

* How do you think you're perceived by those who don't share this same working style?
* What advice do you have for those who identify with a different working style?

### Small Group Discussion # 2 (15 minutes)

The facilitator will mix groups based on working styles and discuss key takeaways from their first discussion. Students are encouraged to focus on these two questions:

* How do you think you're perceived by those who don't share this same working style?
* What advice do you have for those who identify with a different working style?

### Individual Reflection (5 minutes)

* What actions do you want to take for yourself and your cohort to be successful at Turing?
* How can you leverage your place on the spectrum of introversion/extroversion to impact your career in the future?

### Closing (5 minutes)

Students will be asked to take their individual reflection to cohort retro where the cohort will brainstorm a set of norms going forward.
