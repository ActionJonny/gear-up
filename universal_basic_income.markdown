## Mission Alignment

*Our mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.*

When you graduate Turing and enter the tech industry, many of you are likely to develop applications that allow companies to automate tasks and processes...

## Goals of Session

Students should be able to do the following.

*   Describe the effects of automation on the US and global economy.
*   Explore the implications of policy solutions like universal basic income (UBI) and engage in respectful debate on a complex topic.
*   Develop and clearly articulate opinions and analysis on complex topics.


## Read and Write (15 min)

As you read through these article on universal basic income (UBI) as a response to job loss from automation, reflect on the following questions:

*   How would you describe the "realities" of our future economy? What constraints and opportunities will we face as a nation?
*   What's your reaction to hearing tech leaders like Elon Musk describe UBI as a "foregone conclusion."
*   Write a quick elevator pitch synthesizing what you've read from these articles: what is UBI, why is it entering policy debates, what do you think people should know about automation and its affect on our workforce?
*   Do you think it's worthwhile to be educated about automation, its affect on our workforce, and policy solutions like UBI? What does it look like to be a responsible citizen in the face of such a large, inevitable transformation? Do you think you can really have an impact -- if not, why put energy into being informed?
