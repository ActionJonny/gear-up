# Universal Basic Income

## Mission Alignment

*Our mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.*

As your technical careers progress, most of the work you will do is to automate processes that have been done manually. Our mission is to “unlock human potential.” The software we write enables it’s users to be more productive, and to direct energy toward solving increasingly difficult problems. However, some automation, especially of physical processes, can force some out of the jobs they’ve done for years. This has the potential to do more harm than good for inclusion in our society.


## Read and Write (15 min read/10 min write)

As you read through theses article on universal basic income (UBI) as a response to job loss from automation, reflect on the following questions:

*   How would you describe the "realities" of our future economy? What constraints and opportunities will we face as a nation?
*   What's your reaction to hearing tech leaders like Elon Musk describe UBI as a "foregone conclusion"?
*   Write a quick elevator pitch synthesizing what you've read from these articles: what is UBI, why is it entering policy debates, what do you think people should know about automation and its affect on our workforce?
*   Do you think it's worthwhile to be educated about automation, its affect on our workforce, and policy solutions like UBI? What does it look like to be a responsible citizen in the face of such a large, inevitable transformation? Do you think you can really have an impact -- if not, why put energy into being informed?
