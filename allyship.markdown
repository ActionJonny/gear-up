# Allyship

When we talk about cultural and systemic discrimination as large-scale, social issues, we run the risk of overlooking the ways in which we can use our relationships and daily interactions to effectively challenge undesireable norms.

In previous Gear Ups, we've explored the ways in which we can unwittingly participate in behavior that alienates others or perpetuates inequality and injustice in our workplaces and communities. We can also approach this topic through another lens: **what opportunities, if any, do you have to effectively challenge these issues when you encounter them**?

"Allyship" is a wonky word to describe a way of viewing your relationships and interactions as small but often powerful opportunities to tackle these larger social issues. Today, we will consider some essays on the topic of allyship and discuss whether or not these strategies seem meaningful and realistic.

## Structure

* You should already be in your assigned small group with your facilitator
* You'll read independently for about 12 minutes
* You'll then independently process through writing for another 12 minutes
* Finally you'll come together as a small group to discuss

## Reading (~12 Minutes)

Your small group should have copies of the articles listed below. The expectation is that
during this period you'll read at least two of these, but it can be any two.

* [White Anti-Racism: Living the Legacy](http://www.tolerance.org/supplement/white-anti-racism-living-legacy)  
* [11 Things White People Can Do To Be Real Anti-Racist Allies](http://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/11-things-white-people-can-do-be-real-anti-racist-allies)  
* [Emma Watson: Gender Equality is Your Issue Too](http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2014/9/emma-watson-gender-equality-is-your-issue-too)  

## Writing (~12 Minutes)

After taking a few minutes to digest the readings above, consider these questions.  

The scenarios listed below have all been reported to have happened here at Turing. What would you do in this situation? Based on the readings, how would an ally respond? Can you see yourself taking on the role of an ally in this situation?   

### Scenario 1

You're pairing with two other teammates when another person from your cohort walks over and jokingly says hi to one of your teammates, "Hey, what's up my n****r?!?" Your friend responds by giving him a high-five. What, if anything, do you do? If you were a person who felt especially targeted by that word, how would you hope your classmates would respond in that situation? If you were the person who used that word and didn't think it was a big deal, how could someone approach you in a way that might make you think differently in the future?  

### Scenario 2

You know there are several people in your cohort who don't drink, but come Thursday, most of your friends want to go to a bar down the street. It's someone's birthday today, so your cohort's "social coordinator" invites everyone out, but you know there are several people who won't be comfortable being at a bar. What, if anything, do you do?  If you were a person who felt especially excluded, how would you hope your classmates would respond in that situation? If you were the "social coordinator," how could someone approach you about the issue? Is this an issue worth discussing?  

### Scenario 3

### Scenario 4

## Discussion (~22 Minutes)

Within your group, consider these questions:

* Review the scenarios described above. How did each of you respond? What are the implications of different responses?
* Allyship, a social-responsibility buzzword, risks polarizing a community between people who are militantly politically correct and those who think being a good person is a matter of common sense. How would you describe your attitude toward these topics? What can you learn from people with a different perspective?
* In a previous GearUp, we discussed the concept of "microaggressions." Could you say that a small act of allyship is the opposite of a microaggression? Does action at this small level really make a difference?
* Proponents of the allyship lense of social responsibility would argue that focusing on this scale is viable way of changing large-scale systemic issues. Do you agree? What is your theory of change?

## Debrief: (~5 Minutes)

Before we break for lunch, write your main takeaway on a post-it and put it on the whiteboard at the front of the main workspace.
