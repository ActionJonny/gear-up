# Turing Citizenship #3: Cohort Vision

## Mission Alignment
*Our mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.*

Many students describe Turing as one of the most challenging experiences of their lives. On top of new material and a heavy workload, Turing requires students to learn in new ways, get comfortable with the discomfort of not always knowing where to start, and fail repeatedly as part of the frustrating, utterly delightful process of learning.

In order to fulfill Turing's mission, we make concerted effort to help students develop and practice the mindsets we know they'll need to be successful in this setting and the field: growth, engagement, agency, empathy, and grit. Our curriculum and instructional support advance this goal, but that alone is not enough to impart these ways of thinking.

One of the most important features of our community is our culture of mutual support, curiosity, and love of challenge. In their first module at Turing, students will reap the benefits of this culture; this is also when we expect them to begin contributing to it. With a combination of group work, pairings, agile processes, and activities like today's, M1 students are given tools and time to build strong and positive relationships with classmates built on mutual support, encouragement, and accountability.

Over four sessions, students will have an opportunity to connect and organize around the values and goals that brought them to Turing.

  1. **Public Narrative:** Tell a story to build positive professional relationships
  2. **Cohort Vision:** Articulate the cultural attributes and strengths valued by the cohort
  3. **Defining Our Work:** Envision what that culture looks, sounds, and feels like
  4. **Retrospective:** Reflect on what worked and what to build on

Together, these four sessions will help students create a culture of mutual support within their cohort and identify how to tackle challenges with empathy and agility.  


#### Goals
Today's session will take an agile approach to reflecting on and developing your cohort culture. Students will:

* Identify what worked well this past module and what should change
* Work in small groups to troubleshoot opportunities to improve
* Reflect on and share gratitudes towards each other

By the end of the session, students will have some clear priorities to focus on as a group moving into next inning. And there will be some celebrating of all the successes from the earlier six weeks.

## +/Δ Individual Reflection (5 min)
| Symbol | How the hell to say it | What it means|
| ---- |----- | ------|
| + | "plus" | worked well |
| Δ | "delta" | should change |

Students will reflect together on the following questions: What helped them individually and collectively toward their goals? What would they like to change next module?


## +/Δ Pair Reflect (5 min)
Students will discuss individual reflections with a partner.


## +/Δ Report Out (10 min)
Capture all the insight from pair discussions on the whiteboard with a +/Δ chart.


## Vote (5 min)
The facilitator distills topics in the Δ column and holds a vote where students can prioritize topics for further discussion. Each student gets 3 votes, can put all votes on one topic or spread across 3.


## Breakout Groups (25 min)
Students self-select into one of the 4-5 topics deemed most urgent by the group. Each group is responsible for the following:

* Clearly define challenge/opportunity
* Identify strategy for tackling issue
* Clarify next steps and delegate responsibilities


## Report Out (5 min)
Each group will report out to the cohort with their reflections on the three prompts.
