# Turing Citizenship #3: Cohort Vision

## Mission Alignment
*Our mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.*

Many students describe Turing as one of the most challenging experiences of their lives. On top of new material and a heavy workload, Turing requires students to learn in new ways, get comfortable with the discomfort of not always knowing where to start, and fail repeatedly as part of the frustrating, utterly delightful process of learning.

In order to fulfill Turing's mission, we make concerted effort to help students develop and practice the mindsets we know they'll need to be successful in this setting and the field: growth, engagement, agency, empathy, and grit. Our curriculum and instructional support advance this goal, but that alone is not enough to impart these ways of thinking.

One of the most important features of our community is our culture of mutual support, curiosity, and love of challenge. In their first module at Turing, students will reap the benefits of this culture; this is also when we expect them to begin contributing to it. With a combination of group work, pairings, agile processes, and activities like today's, M1 students are given tools and time to build strong and positive relationships with classmates built on mutual support, encouragement, and accountability.

Over four sessions, students will have an opportunity to connect and organize around the values and goals that brought them to Turing.

  1. **Public Narrative:** Tell a story to build positive professional relationships
  2. **Identifying Strengths:** Articulate the cultural attributes and strengths valued by the cohort
  3. **Cohort Vision:** Envision what that culture looks, sounds, and feels like
  4. **Retrospective:** Reflect on what worked and what to build on

Together, these four sessions will help students create a culture of mutual support within their cohort and identify how to tackle challenges with empathy and agility.  

#### Goals
Today's session will be focused on developing a vision for the cohort. Students will:

* Review synthesized cohort strengths and reflections from last week's session
* Engage a visioning exercise
* Write vision statements for their cohort
* Articulate vision for cohort culture in pairs and as a group

By the end of the session, students will gain clarity around their mutual goals and aspirations for their time at Turing.


## Recap of Last Session (5 min)
Designated volunteers will share notes from last session.


## Guided Imagery (15 min)
Even if it feels a little uncharacteristically new agey for a programming school, guided imagery is a research-based tactic for helping individuals and groups plan and articulate goals. It is used widely in performance activities (sports, music) as well as organizational development.

For this exercise, student should get comfortable (laying on the floor is fair game) while the facilitator dims the lights. At the facilitator's prompting, students will close their eyes and be led through a series of prompts.

* If someone walks into your classroom on the evening before your final project is due, what would they see?
* After you've all turned in a project and are waiting for wrap up, what are you talking about? What does it look like and sound like?
* When you have your graduation celebration and Jeff is toasting you, what does he celebrate about your cohort?
* When you're sitting for your portfolio review at the end of the module, sharing the individual, group, and community work you've done, how do you feel?
* How do you feel when you're sitting for your final portfolio review? After you ring the graduation bell and your classmate swaps in for her or his portfolio review, what do you say to each other?


## Individual Reflection (15 min)
Students write down all the images, sounds, and feelings that came up during the guided imagery exercise. After they've captured everything they can remember, students attempt to write a "vision statement" that captures their "vision". Vision statements should be no more than 2-3 sentences. Some examples are listed here.

_I see us having wildly different, interesting passions and goals, and supporting each other in realizing them_

_I see a cohort that is a leader in the school, welcoming new students and helping each other feel safe to make mistakes, garbage fires, and create some beautiful things. People look to me for guidance and advice, and I'm able to respond with poise and confidence even if I don't always know the answer_


## Pair Share (8 min)
Students share with a partner what came up during the visioning exercise and the vision statement that lays out the future for the student and cohort. Partners should play an active role in asking questions and helping each other clarify the details and qualities that are most important to each other.


## Report Out (15 min)
As a group, students report out what came from pair conversations. What did it feel like? What ideas were they excited about?


## Next Steps
Weeks 5 and 6 will be an opportunity for individual students to synthesize what they've learned this past module and demonstrate their ability to move to M2. The stress and technical challenges will surpass those of earlier in the module; for this reason, these weeks tend to be a time when cohorts  solidify their relationships and dynamics. In our experience, cohorts that foster a culture of support and encouragement come through these stressors much stronger.
