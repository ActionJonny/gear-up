# Turing Citizenship #3: Defining Our Work

## Mission Alignment
*Our mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.*

Many students describe Turing as one of the most challenging experiences of their lives. On top of new material and a heavy workload, Turing requires students to learn in new ways, get comfortable with the discomfort of not always knowing where to start, and fail repeatedly as part of the frustrating, utterly delightful process of learning.

In order to fulfill Turing's mission, we make concerted effort to help students develop and practice the mindsets we know they'll need to be successful in this setting and the field: growth, engagement, agency, empathy, and grit. Our curriculum and instructional support advance this goal, but that alone is not enough to impart these ways of thinking.

One of the most important features of our community is our culture of mutual support, curiosity, and love of challenge. In their first module at Turing, students will reap the benefits of this culture; this is also when we expect them to begin contributing to it. With a combination of group work, pairings, agile processes, and activities like today's, M1 students are given tools and time to build strong and positive relationships with classmates built on mutual support, encouragement, and accountability.

Over four sessions, students will have an opportunity to connect and organize around the values and goals that brought them to Turing.

  1. **Public Narrative:** Tell a story to build positive professional relationships
  2. **Cohort Vision:** Articulate the cultural attributes and strengths valued by the cohort
  3. **Defining Our Work:** Envision what that culture looks, sounds, and feels like
  4. **Retrospective:** Reflect on what worked and what to build on

Together, these four sessions will help students create a culture of mutual support within their cohort and identify how to tackle challenges with empathy and agility.  

#### Goals
Today's session will be focused on operationalizing the cohort vision. Students will:

* Review vision statement
* Identify group strategies for advancing the vision
* Identify individual strategies for advancing the group vision

By the end of the session, students will have a clear idea of how to make their cohort vision a reality.


## Recap of Vision from Last Session (10 min)
SAB representatives will share notes from last session.


## Write about Strategies to Achieve Vision (5 min)
In notebooks, students reflect on _how_ their cohort can achieve the culture envisioned. What activities, practices, and behavior will advance the cohort's goals?


## Small Group Discussion (10 min)
In groups of 3-4, students discuss ideas from their writing.


## Report Out and Voting (10 min)
Each group reports out the ideas they identified. Students will vote on the ideas they think will be most impactful.


## Breakout Groups (20 min)
Students divide into groups, with each group assigned one of the winning ideas. If your topic requires buy-in from outside individuals (instructors, staff, other cohorts), engage one of the facilitators to discuss tactics for generating buy-in.


## Report Out (5 min)
Each group reports out on their ideas and next steps.
