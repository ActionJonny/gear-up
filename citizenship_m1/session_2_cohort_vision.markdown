# Turing Citizenship #2: Identifying Strengths

## Mission Alignment
*Our mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.*

Many students describe Turing as one of the most challenging experiences of their lives. On top of new material and a heavy workload, Turing requires students to learn in new ways, get comfortable with the discomfort of not always knowing where to start, and fail repeatedly as part of the frustrating, utterly delightful process of learning.

In order to fulfill Turing's mission, we make concerted effort to help students develop and practice the mindsets we know they'll need to be successful in this setting and the field: growth, engagement, agency, empathy, and grit. Our curriculum and instructional support advance this goal, but that alone is not enough to impart these ways of thinking.

One of the most important features of our community is our culture of mutual support, curiosity, and love of challenge. In their first module at Turing, students will reap the benefits of this culture; this is also when we expect them to begin contributing to it. With a combination of group work, pairings, agile processes, and activities like today's, M1 students are given tools and time to build strong and positive relationships with classmates built on mutual support, encouragement, and accountability.

Over four sessions, students will have an opportunity to connect and organize around the values and goals that brought them to Turing.

  1. **Public Narrative:** Tell a story to build positive professional relationships
  2. **Identifying Strengths:** Articulate the cultural attributes and strengths valued by the cohort
  3. **Cohort Vision:** Envision what that culture looks, sounds, and feels like
  4. **Retrospective:** Reflect on what worked and what to build on

Together, these four sessions will help students create a culture of mutual support within their cohort and identify how to tackle challenges with empathy and agility.  


#### Goals
Today's session will allow students to reflect on the qualities of Turing's culture they value and how they might contribute to that culture. Students will:

* Reflect on the qualities of Turing's culture that are most valued
* Articulate the individual and collective strengths of the cohort
* Begin to define what is most valued about the cohort's culture

By the end of the session, students will have some clarity about what their classmates value in each other and in the community.


## Panel Discussion: Success at Turing (25 min)
Alumni and current M4 students will share what was most important to them during their time at Turing, lessons learned, and the parts of Turing culture they're most grateful for.


## Turing Culture (15 min)
In groups of 4, discuss the qualities of Turing's culture that you value most.

* Are they different than you thought they'd be when you applied.
* Which have you most benefitted from?
* Are there any qualities you haven't directly benefitted from but still value?
* What qualities are most important to advancing Turing's mission?

Capture these ideas on sticky notes and post them on the wall where designated. Try to cluster your notes by topic, and move them around if you need to. When all the groups have posted their sticky notes, take a few minutes to review other group's contributions.


## Shout-Outs (10 min)
One student will start off a chain of shout-outs. Each student will call out a classmate, describe something they appreciate about that classmate and how that enriches the cohort. No dupes. This should take about 10 minutes for every student to contribute.


## Synthesis (5 min)
After shout outs, return to your groups of 4 and reflect on what themes stood out to you from the classmate strengths that were named. Which matter most to you? If you consider what you want your cohort's _legacy_ to be, which are most important?


## Report Out (5 min)
Each group will share insight from their conversations


## Next Steps
During next week's session 3, we will return to these themes and discuss how to build around them. Select 2 volunteers from the cohort to organize each groups main themes and present them next session.
