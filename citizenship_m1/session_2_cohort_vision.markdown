# Turing Citizenship #2: Cohort Vision

## Mission Alignment
*Our mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.*

Many students describe Turing as one of the most challenging experiences of their lives. On top of new material and a heavy workload, Turing requires students to learn in new ways, get comfortable with the discomfort of not always knowing where to start, and fail repeatedly as part of the frustrating, utterly delightful process of learning.

In order to fulfill Turing's mission, we make concerted effort to help students develop and practice the mindsets we know they'll need to be successful in this setting and the field: growth, engagement, agency, empathy, and grit. Our curriculum and instructional support advance this goal, but that alone is not enough to impart these ways of thinking.

One of the most important features of our community is our culture of mutual support, curiosity, and love of challenge. In their first module at Turing, students will reap the benefits of this culture; this is also when we expect them to begin contributing to it. With a combination of group work, pairings, agile processes, and activities like today's, M1 students are given tools and time to build strong and positive relationships with classmates built on mutual support, encouragement, and accountability.

Over four sessions, students will have an opportunity to connect and organize around the values and goals that brought them to Turing.

  1. **Public Narrative:** Tell a story to build positive professional relationships
  2. **Cohort Vision:** Articulate the cultural attributes and strengths valued by the cohort
  3. **Defining Our Work:** Envision what that culture looks, sounds, and feels like
  4. **Retrospective:** Reflect on what worked and what to build on

Together, these four sessions will help students create a culture of mutual support within their cohort and identify how to tackle challenges with empathy and agility.  


#### Preparation
To prepare for today's cohort vision session, students should read the following three articles.
* []()
* []()
* []()
(Disparities in Tech, cultural norms, empathy)


#### Goals
Today's session will be focused on developing a vision for cohort culture. Students will:

* Reflect what role a mission-driven programming school has in addressing the disparities described in provided articles
* Hear from Jeff and alumni about how Turing's culture relates to its mission
* Identify the qualities of Turing's culture, current cohort culture that are most valued by cohort members
* Articulate vision for cohort culture in pairs and as a group

By the end of the session, students will connect their personal and group norms to Turing's larger community.


## Pair Share (10 min)
In pairs, students will reflect on their readings and their connection to Turing's mission through the following prompts.

* What concerns did the homework articles raise for you? How do the depictions of some tech culture compare to what see as the cultural strengths of the industry?
* What role can a programming school play in addressing some of these concerns? How can we support students while in our program?
* How can Turing demonstrate leadership and equip our students to demonstrate leadership around these issues when they enter the field?


## Panel Discussion (25 min)
Turing leadership, fellow students, and alumni will discuss their perspectives on the role Turing can play in addressing disparities in the field and how Turing's culture advances this work.


## Writing Reflection (5 min)
In notebooks, students reflect on the following questions.
* What values stood out to you during the panel discussion?
* Did the vision of Turing the panelists presented match what you hoped Turing would be when you applied? How? If not, what was different?
* What image of Turing most resonated with you? Describe it.


## Pomodoro (5 min)


## Guided Imagery (15 min)
It may seem uncharacteristically new agey for a programming school, yet guided imagery is a research-based tactic for helping individuals and groups plan and articulate goals. It is used widely by performers (athletes, musicians, etc.) as well as within the fields of organizational, professional, and community development.

For this exercise, student should get comfortable (laying on the floor is fair game) while the facilitator dims the lights. At the facilitator's prompting, students will close their eyes and be led through a series of prompts.

* If someone walks into your classroom on the evening before your final project is due, what would they see?
* After you've all turned in a project and are waiting for wrap up, what are you talking about? What does it look like and sound like?
* When you have your graduation celebration and your instructors are singing your praises, what do they celebrate about your cohort?
* When you're sitting for your portfolio review at the end of the module, sharing the individual, group, and community work you've done, how do you feel?
* When you finish your final M4 portfolio review and strike the graduation gong, you walk past your fellow classmate who's been waiting for his or her turn. What do you say to each other in passing? What expressions do you exchange?


## Individual Reflection (15 min)
Students write down all the images, sounds, and feelings that came up during the guided imagery exercise. After they've captured everything they can remember, students attempt to write a "vision statement" that captures their "vision". Vision statements should be no more than 2-3 sentences. Some examples are listed here.

_I see us having wildly different, interesting passions and goals, and supporting each other in realizing them_

_I see a cohort that is a leader in the school, welcoming new students and helping each other feel safe to make mistakes, garbage fires, and create some beautiful things. People look to me for guidance and advice, and I'm able to respond with poise and confidence even if I don't always know the answer_


## Group Share (10 min)
In groups of 3-4, students share with each other what came up during the visioning exercise and the vision statement that lays out the future for the student and cohort. Partners should play an active role in asking questions and helping each other clarify the details and qualities that are most important to each other.


## Report Out (5 min)
A point person from each team shares what came from their conversations. What ideas were they excited about? Where did their visions overlap?

SAB members take notes.
