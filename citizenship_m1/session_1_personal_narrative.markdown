# Turing Citizenship #1: Public Narrative

## Mission Alignment
Many students describe Turing as one of the most challenging experiences of their lives. On top of new material and a heavy workload, Turing requires student to think differently then they have in the past, get comfortable with the discomfort of not always knowing where to start, and fail repeatedly as part of the frustrating, utterly delightful process of learning.

As students make their way through these challenges, they will be working in close proximity with each other. Perhaps no one else knows as much about the emotional and technical struggles you face as a classmate, similarly encountering the same issues. For students to thrive in this environment, they'll need strong and positive relationships with classmates, relationship built on mutual support, encouragement, and accountability.

Over four sessions, we set aside time for students to build these relationships in meaningful ways around the values and goals that brought them to Turing.
  1. **Public Narrative:** How to tell your story to build positive professional relationships
  2. **Cohort Vision:** How to arrive at a shared vision for your time at Turing
  3. **From Vision to Action:** Set priorities as a cohort to achieve the culture you desire
  4. **Retrospective:** Reflect on what worked and what to build on as you move into M2

Together, these four sessions will help students clarify their goals for the program, how to create a culture of mutual support within their cohort, and how to tackle challenges together with agility.  

#### Goals
Today's session will be focused on Public Narrative. Students will:

* Articulate their public narrative: what led to the decision to come and what meaning does it hold?
* Set intentions around how to face Turing's challenges
* Share their stories in a way that helps build positive relationships with peers

Public narrative is an important tool for building relationships at Turing and will also help you understand how to present yourself in the industry and with potential employers.

## Panel Discussion (25 min)
Join us in S300 to hear from Turing alumni about their experience before, during, and after Turing.

## Break (5 min)

## Develop Personal Stories (25 min)
We will begin this session with 5 minutes of individual reflection using this worksheet [turing.io](link TBD).

For the second part of the session, students will work in groups of 4 to share their personal stories and receive feedback on how to more effectively communicate their experiences. Each person will share for 2 minutes, then the group will take 2 min to give feedback. Use this worksheet ([turing.io](link TBD)) to organize feedback.

## Break (5 min)

## Sharing (90 min)
We will have snacks and drinks and share our stories.
