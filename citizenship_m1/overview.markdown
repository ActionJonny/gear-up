# Turing M1 Citizenship Curriculum Overview

*Our mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.*

Many students describe Turing as one of the most challenging experiences of their lives. On top of new material and a heavy workload, Turing requires students to learn in new ways, get comfortable with the discomfort of not always knowing where to start, and fail repeatedly as part of the frustrating, utterly delightful process of learning.

In order to fulfill Turing's mission, we make concerted effort to help students develop and practice the mindsets we know they'll need to be successful in this setting and the field: growth, engagement, agency, empathy, and grit. Our curriculum and instructional support advance this goal, but that alone is not enough to impart these ways of thinking.

One of the most important features of our community is our culture of mutual support, curiosity, and love of challenge. In their first module at Turing, students will reap the benefits of this culture; this is also when we expect them to begin contributing to it. With a combination of group work, pairings, agile processes, and activities like today's, M1 students are given tools and time to build strong and positive relationships with classmates built on mutual support, encouragement, and accountability.

Over four sessions, students will have an opportunity to connect and organize around the values and goals that brought them to Turing.

  1. **Public Narrative:** Tell a story to build positive professional relationships ([link](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/citizenship_m1/session_1_personal_narrative.markdown))
  2. **Identifying Strengths:** Articulate the cultural attributes and strengths valued by the cohort ([link](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/citizenship_m1/session_2_cohort_vision.markdown))
  3. **Cohort Vision:** Envision what that culture looks, sounds, and feels like ([link](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/citizenship_m1/session_3_defining_our_work.markdown))
  4. **Retrospective:** Reflect on what worked and what to build on ([link](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/citizenship_m1/session_4_retrospective.markdown))

Together, these four sessions will help students create a culture of mutual support within their cohort and identify how to tackle challenges with empathy and agility.
