# Journey Mapping

## Mission Alignment
*Our mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.*

Being able to empathize with end users is a skill that leads to better software and better services. At Turing, we structure our curriculum to provide hundreds of opportunities to interact with others in ways that help students build the skills then need to envision end users goals and needs.

Today we will be focused on a specific process that supports user-centered design: user journey mapping. User journey mapping provides a structure for organizing and driving change and user-experience improvements from user-centered interviews and focus groups.

## Goal of Session
By the end of this session, students should be able to do the following.
* Articulate questions to more deeply understand another's experience
* Practice empathy to identify the actions, thoughts and feelings of another individual
* Construct a journey map to document an individual's experience with a service


## Workshop (50 min)
We will be using each other as "users" for today's workshop. Half of the groups will be creating user journey maps of frontend students' experiences and half will be focused on backend students' experiences.

1. **Define the scope of your map:** Your group has some leeway in what aspects of your user's experience you'd like to document. Though the scope isn't dictated, you'll want to pick a narrow enough topic that you can tackle in the allotted minutes.
2. **Clarify the user's goal:** Engage your user(s) to understand what their goal is within the scope you've defined.
3. **Capture user's steps to achieve goal:** What actions must your user take to be successful?
4. **Capture easy and painful points in process:** Engage your user to understand what _thoughts_ and _feelings_ arise through the process. What parts are joyful? What parts are frustrating?
5. **Capture parallel staff experiences (OPTIONAL):** If there is a staff member in your group, engage them and inquire about their experience of the joy and pain points along your user's journey? Why do they do what they do at those intersections?

By the end of the session, take a photo of your journey map and submit it [here](https://docs.google.com/a/casimircreative.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScIhuqFSXaVGEHKd2njlKuJnq2NrDwHAfMGQswu6jEjxYxs_Q/viewform).
