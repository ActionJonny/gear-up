# Microaggressions

## Mission Alignment
*Our mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.*

A microaggression is defined as a "subtle but offensive comment or action directed at a minority or other nondominant group that is often unintentional or unconsciously reinforces a stereotype." This term was first coined in the 1970s but its application today can sometimes be confusing. 

Turing has a mission-critical responsibility to create a culture in which the messages behind microaggressions are consistently named and challenged. But first, we need to understand what these microaggressions are This culture has immediate consequences for students in our program who are more likely to be targets of microaggressions. There are long-term advantages as well; by cultivating student empathy for the effects of these subtle messages, this culture also helps all students practice and develop skills to be more effective advocates for underrepresented groups in tech after they graduate.

## Goal of Session
By the end of this session, students should be able to do the following.
* Understand "microaggressions" 
* 

* Practice empathy for targets of microaggressions

## Write (10 min)
Pick one of Chee's encounters from "A Month of Microaggressions" and reflect on how that episode, in the context of regular similar incidents, would affect you if you were Chee. If helpful, you can use these questions to guide your reflection.

* How would you feel, physically, immediately after this encounter?
* How would you feel, emotionally, immediately after this encounter?
* How do you feel about the person who directed that comment at you?
* If the encounter happened in an establishment (acting class, coffee shop), does that change your attitudes toward the establishment?
* How would you recover from the incident? Assuming the incident was somewhat upsetting, what process would you go through to get back to how you felt beforehand?


## Discuss (25 min)
Before you begin discussing this topic, ensure that the following roles are delegated to members of your group.

| Role | Description |
|--------|-----------|
| **Timekeeper** | Ensure that the group has a chance to address all the discussion questions and time at the end to complete the survey.|
| **Facilitator** | Works with the timekeeper to move through the discussion questions. Solicits input from all members of the group and helps individuals be aware if they are dominating the conversation.|
| **Participant (all)** | Listens actively, is respectful and engaged, takes responsibility for all members having a chance to share their perspectives and learn from others. |

Allow each person in your group 2 minutes to share their reactions to the writing prompt above. Then, pick _one_ of the following prompts to focus on for the rest of your time.
* **Lived Experiences:** I've been a target of microaggressions. For example... This is the effect it had on me. Listening to others share is a valid form of participation for this topic.
* **Organizational Leadership:** If you worked for a company or organization that valued inclusion and diversity, do you think it's appropriate to educate employees about microaggressions? _How_ would you do it in a way that doesn't come across as just asking everyone to be "politically correct"?
