# Session 1  *Align to Gear up Goals (EM add)

### Facilitator Set Up:
* Put students in groups of 4-5 maximum
* Pull up the Gear Up Markdown that students will be updating 
* Pull up the survey feedback from the last time the session was facilitated

## Framing (5 min)

In Mod 4, we want you to round out your Gear Up experience and continue to develop skills that could be beneficial to you in the future.  In this module, you are going to review a past Gear Up session and make improvements to it in order to ensure that we are continuing to build towards our mission.  In Gear Up Sessions on weeks 1 and 3, you will spend time reviewing feedback and making updates to a past session.   In week 5, we want to encourage you to faciliate a small group session or participate in the newly designed session to experience the improvements.  We will take you step by step through this process.

Skill Focus <br>
	* Feedback analysis<br>
	* Research<br>
	* Facilitation of small groups <br>
	* Process improvement 

## Feedback Analysis 15 min
Review the session markdown they are updating
Fork/clone original session (Can we create a file for students to upload into?)
Review feedback from past session  (EM needs to put together because it is in the student survey)

Potential Ways to Change Sessions:
* Update the CONTENT: Videos, articles, etc
* Update the PROCESS for learning
	* How should students be grouped?  <br>
	* What types of reflection should students do?<br>
	* What questions should students answer?<br>
	* What order should things happen in?  Read--video--reflect?  Group discussion--video--reflect?
