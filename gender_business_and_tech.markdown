# Gender diversity in the workplace
Increasing diversity in tech is a Turing school value. On International Women's Day (March 8th), this statement was made from on high:
> We just pledged for gender parity, you should too.

While many people accept the vague premise that diversity is good, sometimes this premise can feel like a "politically-correct" statement and not a fact based on data.
>74 percent of companies report that their CEOs are highly committed to gender diversity. However, less than half of employees believe that gender diversity is a top priority for their CEO, and only a third view it as a top priority for their direct manager.

>[*Women in the workplace*](http://womenintheworkplace.com/)

Today, we are going to try to expose everyone to a subset of the data that is available on the issue of gender equality and the business importance of gender equality. This is by no means comprehensive. It is an attempt to begin discourse that is based on facts rather than vagueries.

## Gear-up structure
There is a lot of information presented in the first three time blocks. Please spend some time reading and some time reflecting for each section. Then come together to discuss with your small group. We will end by sharing with the large group a snippet from the small group discussions.

* Women in tech: many many numbers (15 minutes)
* Numerical exercise (5 minutes)
* I'm not female, but I CAN also bring diversity to the table (10 minutes)
* Small group discussion (20 minutes)
* Reconvene and share with the large group (5-10 minutes)

## Women in tech: many many numbers (15 minutes)
Begin by spending some time reading this report:
* #### [**The Case for Investing in Women**](http://1uly8a1a5aff3hmeqt1svyjy.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/The-Case-for-Investing-in-Women-314.pdf)

#### Questions to think about:
1. What was the most interesting statistic that you found in this report?
2. Why do we still see [low female representation in tech](https://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/resources/btn_03092016_web.pdf) (basically 25% women in the computing workforce) year after year?
3. Can you help in some way to change the statistics?
2. Did you believe the numbers in this report? Do you think that the statistics were biased? Why/why not?
3. If you believed that the statistics were biased, what additional data would you like to see? Are you comfortable with statistical analysis? What could you do to back your skepticism with numbers?
4. Are you familiar with [McKinsey & Co.](http://www.mckinsey.com/)? Do you believe that they are less biased than the [Anita Borg Institute](http://anitaborg.org/) (the writers of this report)? Check out [their study](http://womenintheworkplace.com/ui/pdfs/Women_in_the_Workplace_2015.pdf?v=5).


## Numerical exercise: (5 minutes)
We have seen that there is business motivation to increase gender diversity, but we regularly hear statements like this:
> “If there are qualified blacks/Latinos/women/etc out there, we’d love to hire them — but we’re not going to lower the bar.”

>taken from [What You’re Really Saying When You Talk About Lowering the Bar in Hiring]( https://medium.com/life-tips/what-you-re-really-saying-when-you-talk-about-lowering-the-bar-in-hiring-a30d9b12430f#.eukf9ks9d)

Is this actually true and what can we do about it? Let's run with some really basic numbers. These numbers are not necessarily correct because of [bias in the application process](https://hbr.org/2014/08/why-women-dont-apply-for-jobs-unless-theyre-100-qualified/) but go with it.


** OVERVIEW: ** I am going to hire 10 new workers this year. I would like to bring my gender numbers to 50/50 because I  believe in diversity from a business standpoint. (Let's not discuss my current demographics) So, my goal is to hire 5 women and 5 men. I put up a job ad, and I get 100 applicants.

**Scenario A:** Out of my 100 applicants, 30 are female and 70 are male, (we're loosely mimicking the demographics of developers/engineers/computer scientists in industry). Let's say we have a uniform distribution of technical skill ratings, 1-10. That means in my pool I have 3 women for each rating 1-10, and I have 7 men for each rating 1-10.

In theory, I would like to hire 10 people with technical ranking 10. But I am trying to ensure that my gender numbers are 50/50, so given my applicant pool, I hire 5 women: 3 who are technically ranked 10, and 2 who are technically ranked 9, and 5 men: 5 who are technically ranked 10.

**Numbers for you to calculate: **

* Average technical skill for newly-hired women:
* Average technical skill for newly-hired men:
* Percent chance of being a woman with technical rank 10 and hired:
* Percent chance of being a man with technical rank 10 and hired:
* Percent chance of being a woman with technical rank 9 and hired:
* Percent chance of being a man with technical rank 9 and hired:

**Scenario B:** Out of my 100 applicants, there is gender parity: 50 are men, 50 are women. Once again, we have a uniform distribution of technical skill ratings, 1-10. That means in my pool I have 5 women for each rating 1-10, and I have 5 men for each rating 1-10. Now, I can hire 10 people with technical ranking 10, 5 women and 5 men.

**Numbers for you to calculate:**

* Average technical skill for newly-hired women:
* Average technical skill for newly-hired men:
* Percent chance of being a woman with technical rank 10 and hired:
* Percent chance of being a man with technical rank 10 and hired:
* Percent chance of being a woman with technical rank 9 and hired:
* Percent chance of being a man with technical rank 9 and hired:


#### Questions to think about:
1. How would you feel if you were a female with ranking 10 in scenario A versus scenario B?
2. How would you feel if you were a male ranking 10 in scenario A versus scenario B?
3. Reality is closer to Scenario A. How do we bridge the gap between A and B without breeding resentment?
4. What were some "unrealistic" things about these scenarios?
5. Are we "lowering the bar" when one tries to hire a disproportional amount of women?

## I'm not female, but I CAN also bring diversity to the table (10 minutes)

Hopefully from the numbers exercise above, you have realized that severe gender inequality hurts people on all sides, male or female, employer or applicant.

Getting to gender equality in tech may not be an immediate issue for you, but getting a job is likely to be something you think about all the time. If you are a high-achieving man, you may feel that your odds of getting a job are hampered by the fact that many companies say that they are trying to hire for diversity (Google, Intel, etc.), and this quite possibly is true as seen from the exercise above.

And what if your life doesn't fit the John Smith white-male stereotype? Why isn't life experience taken into account for diversity? Browse this inforgraphic on:

* #### [**Two-Dimensional Diversity**](http://www.talentinnovation.org/_private/assets/IDMG-infographic-CTI.pdf)

* #### Questions to think about:
  1. Do you believe the argument about two-dimensional diversity? Is there additional data that you would like to see?
  2. Will there be a time in the future that inherent diversity is no longer a thing? What will make this so?
  3. Can you use this concept to make yourself a better candidate for a job?

It would be ideal to have a true meritocracy where everyone was based on their abilities and diversity was a given in the workplace. While we would like to get to a point where gender is not really something we consider, there are some harsh realities to being a woman in tech. Please read about:

* #### [**Further details**](http://elephantinthevalley.com/)
* #### Questions to think about:
  1. Do you believe that these numbers reflect reality? Why or why not?
  2. Is gender inequality a reason for sexual harassment?
  3. Do you think sexual harassment contributes to gender inequality?
  4. Are there actions that you can take to change such statistics? What can women do about these issues? What can men do about these issues?
  5. Sexual harassment seems to be pretty black and white as something not to do. But what about [splaining](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Splaining) or not acknowledging [unconscious bias](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/12/women-considered-better-coders-hide-gender-github?utm_content=bufferda468&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin.com&utm_campaign=buffer)?

## Small group discussion (20 minutes)
Time to share some thoughts!
Go around your small group and share:
1. The most interesting number you saw today in all the readings/articles/exercises/questions
2. One thing that makes you feel insecure about your future in tech
3. One thing that you would like to change about the tech industry and how you think you'll go about it

Open discussion, then take 2 minutes to decide as a group, **what is the one thing you would take away from today's gear-up?**

## Reconvene and share with the large group (5-10 minutes)
Please share with the large group the one takeaway from your small group discussion.
