## Vote Your Conscience

To advance our mission of "unlocking human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers," Turing has a responsibility to actively support students' development of civic and community-oriented skills. In order to be a responsible citizen and advance diversity and inclusion in the tech field, students will need to think critically about systems and structures. They will need to have developed a clear understanding of how to align their actions and values in these systems and have skills for constructively challenging those systems when they are unjust and promote inequity.

A successful Turing graduate is engaged, intentional, and well-informed when evaluating how to participate meaningfully in their communit(ies). Today, we will use the upcoming election as a opportunity to develop the awareness and skills we need to meet this aspiration.

#### Endorsements: Who to Trust?
Many Americans defer to trusted authorities (newspapers, organizations, political parties) to help them vet candidates. In fact, few voters have the time to individually research the positions and backgrounds of all the elected officials on a ballot, and thus rely on information filtered through third parties.
