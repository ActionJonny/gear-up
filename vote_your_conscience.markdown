## Vote Your Conscience 

To advance our mission of "unlocking human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers," Turing has a responsibility to actively support students' development of civic and community-oriented skills. In order to be a responsible citizen and advance diversity and inclusion in the tech field, students will need to think critically about systems and structures. They will need to have developed a clear understanding of how to align their actions and values in these systems and have skills for constructively challenging those systems when they are unjust and promote inequity. 

A successful Turing graduate is engaged, intentional, and well-informed when evaluating how to participate meaningfully in their communit(ies). Today, we will use the upcoming election as a opportunity to develop the awareness and skills we need to meet this aspiration.
