## The Human Team

### Introduction (5 min) 
Turing students need to be able to work effectively on teams.
* analyze the dynamics they're in
* be aware of and understand how their own reactions affect their participation
* connect group dynamics to group efficacy

### Discussion (10 min)
In your assigned group, pick one of the following questions and discuss for 10 minutes. 
* Who is someone who makes or made you feel special and why/how?
* What is something you make or create on a daily basis?
* Do you believe in ghosts? Why or why not?

### Writing (10 min)
Reflect privately on these questions about the discussion you just had.
* What was your first reaction to the question?
* Before sharing, did you take into account how others might react to what you say? How did that make you feel and how did it affect your feelings toward the group?
* Do you feel you had a candid conversation as a group? Would you have changed how you answered the question if you knew you'd never see your teammates again? Or if you were about to begin a long project together? Why?
* Was there anything that bothered you about your dynamic as a group? How might _you_ have contributed to that dynamic? 

### Video (5 min)
Dr. Brene Brown is a shame and vulnerability researcher whose work touches on key themes that may have surfaced during the beginning of this session. Together, we will watch her video, [Boundaries, Empathy, and Compassion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecb6ExBaW80) and experiment with incorporating some of her ideas into our further conversation. 

Based at the University of Houston Graduate College of Social Work, Dr. Brown's work focuses on authentic leadership and what she describes as "wholeheartedness" -- the capacity to engage life and others with authenticity, courage, and compassion.

### Discussion (25 min)
As a group, we're going to continue to dive deeper into the topic of team dynamics, starting by putting some of these ideas into practice. 

First, take a moment to _re_-define the relationship (DTR) as a group by practicing empathy and setting boundaries that respect the varying needs of members of your team.

Allow each person in the group to share concerns or observations he or she had about the group's earlier dynamic. As you go *round-robin* restate the previous person's contribution and reflect (briefly) on what _you_ will do to continue or improve that dynamic _before_ you share your own idea. (5 min)

With those expectations redefined, tackle the following discussion topics as a group.  
* What has been your most successful team experience? 
* What qualities do your teammember's most successful teams share?
* What norms and expectations (stated or unstated) contributed to that team's efficacy? 
* In what ways did you contribute to these norms and expectations? 

Elect someone in your group to synthesize your answers and post them to Slack at the end of the session. 

### Survey (5 min)
Please fill out the survey linked here. In addition to providing staff with feedback on your experience, we've also included some reflection questions to help you process the final round of discussions you had with your team including?

* What did it feel like having to repeat your teammate's comments at the beginning of the exercise and state how you would address his or her concerns?
* How was the dynamic of your first conversation different that the second conversation? What concerns or frustrations, if any, remained?
