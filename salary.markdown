# Salary

> I just believe that the way that young people's minds develop is fascinating.
> If you are doing something for a grade or salary or a reward, it doesn't have

Today let's think, talk, and listen about salary.

## Reading & Writing (15 Minutes)

Your small group will have a pile of several different articles. During this first segment you should:

* Read at two of the articles
* Consider how the sentiments of the article resonate with or are counter to your
own experience.
* Calculate your real cost of attending our program (below)
* If you finish before time is up, read a third article

To calculate the *real cost* of Turing you should:

* Be somewhat pessimistic and estimate that your total time out of work is 10 months. Multiply your most recent salary by 73% to find the ballpark post-tax income, then multiply by 83% to find how much you would have earned during these 10 months.
* Add your total tuition cost (generally $16300 to $21000)
* Add your monthly cost of living multiplied by the 10 months plus any extra money you had to spend to be here (travel, equipment, etc)

Then, to ballpark your salary change, subtract your former yearly salary from $78,000 (the average salary for graduates). If you want to be a bit conservative/pessimistic, subtract another $10K. The result is your annual "profit" of having attended the program.

For the first five years in the industry you can typically expect at least a $7500 annual raise. So in year 1 if you earn `x`, then year two it'll be `x+7500`, year three `x+15000`, etc.

How many years will it take to pay off your investment?

## Discussing

Discussing salary is taboo in America. So let's do it. Discuss some of the
following with your small group:

* What's the most you've ever earned in a year? Was it fulfilling? Was the
money comparable to the effort and heart you put in? Why aren't you doing that
anymore?
* What's it going to take for you to "break even" financially after the real
total cost you've paid to attend Turing? Will anyone in your group be earning less than they did before? How many years would it take to hit their old salary? Who will pay off their investment the fastest?
* What are your goals for salary? Why?
* How do you think your upbringing affects your thinking about salary? Who in your family or close friends earns the most? Who earns the least? Does those people influence you?
* Given your education, age, and upbringing, what do you think you're "supposed to" earn as an annual salary?
* How is that thinking affected by your race, gender, age, sexuality, religion, and relationship/dependents?
* We see job offers to the same student vary by as much as $25K. How will raw salary factor into your job hunt/selection? Is it less or more important than other factors like "culture", "technology stack", etc? Why?
