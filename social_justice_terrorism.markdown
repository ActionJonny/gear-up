# Social Justice Terrorism

The goals of Gear Up are to provoke conversation and help us find/develop the touch points of our group culture.

Provoking conversation isn't always a kumbaya situation. People can feel validated or they can feel attacked. New perspectives can open or old ones can harden.

## Reading

Read the attached essay, Social Justice Terrorism, written by a former Turing student. You can [find it online here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/social-justice-terrorism-drew-conly). Then dive into the writing below.

## Writing

Let's spend about 15 minutes writing on these topics:

* What do you most agree with in the essay?
* When the topic of diversity is discussed, do you feel included? Uplifted? Brow-beaten? Why?
* There are many assertions about gender and gender equity in the piece. Obviously, by the numbers, Turing is gender-inequal. Do you notice that on a frequent basis? Do you think it has an impact on our culture? How?
* When, at Turing or in life, do you feel the most unwelcome because of your identity?
* Victimhood is a deep rut to fall into. What do you do when you feel yourself slipping into that thinking? What/who pulls you out?
* Do you feel like these Gear Up sessions are valuable to you? Do you look forward to them, dread them, or just feel indifferent?
* What's something you've learned in one of these sessions?

## Discuss

When the group wraps up writing then transition to a group conversation. Use the above questions as starting points, but along the way mix in / look for:

* Where are the most stark differences in perspective? Why?
* What was the *most recent* (not the most significant) time you felt unwelcome/undervalued? Look for the differences in the group's answers as an indicator on our silent privilege.
* What can we, as a group, do better?
