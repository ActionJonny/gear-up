# Gear Up

## Overview
As part of the Community Content that Turing offers, students are given the opportunity to participate in a discussion group each Friday of the module called Gear Up. Gear Up sessions are focused on social issues that affect the technology industry.  

The Community Affairs Manager (Allison Singer) will plan each Gear Upâ€™s topic and related readings and discussions for each week, and students are given the opportunity to facilitate the discussions as leaders of small groups.
