# Gear Up

## Overview
Turing's mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers. Our vision is a world powered by technology where the people building it represent the people using it. We're here to build a movement.

In order to advance this mission and vision, our curriculum transcends technical training. We also present students with opportunities to grow as individuals, members of a team, and members of a community. 

Gear Up provides a forum for students to develop self-awareness and interpersonal skills. 
* Curriculum spans 4 modules
* Each module includes 3 Gear Up sessions, one each on personal growth, team dynamics, and social responsibility
* Sessions are targeted at developing specific student competencies in each area
