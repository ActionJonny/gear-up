# Grit Mindset
## Mission Alignment

*Our mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.*

Most students at Turing seem to share a high level of grit, defined as "perseverance and passion for long-term goals." Grit helps students consistently engage and reengage learning opportunities and challenges that are often difficult and frustrating. When we envision the challenges students will face in the field (tackling new problems, mastering new material), grit also appears to be a mindset that students need to succeed after they graduate.

For that reason, we've included grit as a key mindset for students at Turing, and our curriculum is designed to help students cultivate this attitude. However, while we can encourage students to develop passion and practice sticking with difficult material, deep grit depends on students' ownership of their struggle and their ability to adjust their attitude and remind themselves of their passions and motivations when they feel discouraged.

Today's exercise is designed to develop students' awareness of grit and relate it to their personal lives. If grit is not a relevant concept for you, you will want to use this session to clarify why it is not, and reflect on how you will need to manage your attitude in the face of Turing's formidable challenges.

## Goals of Session
By the end of this session, students should be able to do the following.
* Define grit and appreciate the combination of perseverance *and* passion
* Articulate their perspective toward grit as an indicator of success (generally) and how it applies to their life and decisions as a student at Turing

## Watch (7 min)
Together, we will watch grit researcher Angela Duckworth's TEDTalk, ["Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance"](https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance#t-85401).

## Read (8 min)
Independently, we will read this *New York Magazine* article, ["Don’t Believe the Hype About Grit, Pleads the Scientist Behind the Concept"](http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/05/dont-believe-the-hype-about-grit-pleads-the-scientist-behind-the-concept.html) (May 9, 2016), about how grit has been misinterpreted.

## Write
### Explore (10 min)
To begin to process the content of Duckworth's presentation and the *New York Magazine* article, reflect independently in your notebook on these questions.

* According to Duckworth, perseverance and passion are equally important parts of grit. Describe what role each plays in the grit mindset. What’s the danger of overlooking the role of passion in grit?
* There can be a downside to grit. It can be an excuse to accept things as they are, whether the problems are systematic for more localized. How do you know the difference between when to speak up and when to grit it out?
* In what ways has being a student at Turing tested your grit? What strategies have you found effective for owning your struggle?
* Is this bullshit? Is thinking/talking about grit a worthwhile thing to do?

### Prepare for Discussion (5 min)
Review the three questions we’ll focus on for discussion.

* What is grit? How do you gauge if someone has a lot of grit or not?
* Has grit played a meaningful role in your life? How? If not, what qualities do you think have affected your success at Turing the most?
* As a community at Turing, is it worthwhile to discuss grit? Why or why not? How should we otherwise spend our time to raise awareness of the emotional skills students need to succeed?

Write some notes to summarize your response to the question and identify facts or arguments from the video, article, or your own personal experience to support your points.

## Group Work
Before you begin discussing this topic, ensure that the following roles are delegated to members of your group.

| Role | Description |
|--------|-----------|
| **Timekeeper** | Ensure that the group has a chance to address all the discussion questions and time at the end to complete the survey.|
| **Facilitator** | Works with the timekeeper to move through the discussion questions. Solicits input from all members of the group and helps individuals be aware if they are dominating the conversation.|

### Introductions (5 min)
Take a moment to introduce yourself to others in your group: what's your name, program and cohort, where are you from, what brought you to Turing?

### Discussion (20 min)
Take about 6-7 minutes per question. Start by going round robin and allow everyone a chance to share their initial thoughts on the question, then use the remaining time to discuss themes from what was shared.

* What is grit? How do you gauge if someone has a lot of grit or not?
* Has grit played a meaningful role in your life? How? If not, what qualities do you think have affected your success at Turing the most?
* As a community at Turing, is it worthwhile to discuss grit? Why?
