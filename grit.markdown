# Grit

The number one indicator of success at Turing and, likely, in life is your willingness
to own your struggle and be responsible for your success. That mostly boils down to grit.

## Angela Duckworth & Grit

Let's start with Angela Duckworth who studies grit:

## Writing

After the video, take a few minutes to write about the following questions:

* What is a life without grit? What would that look like? Feel like?
* Where is your baseline understanding of struggle? That is, who in your life or
what experiences in your life are the consistent reminder of what struggle looks like?
The benchmark against which you compare your own current struggles?
* Individuals that have strong grit tend to have one or two people in their lives who
are their rock, the immovable object that they can lean against. Do you have a rock?
How did they earn that position? Do they know that you think of them that way?
* What strategies or habits help build and reinforce your grit?
* Grit can be self destructive if taken too far. When do you know it's time to quit?
* There can be a downside to grit. It can be an excuse to accept things as they are,
whether the problems are systematic for more localized. How do you know the difference
between when to speak up and when to grit it out?

## Listening & Talking

Let's take the rest of the period to discuss in your small groups:

* Is this bullshit? Is thinking/talking about grit a worthwhile thing to do?
* Is grit born or built? If built, why wouldn't a person choose to have grit?
* Did you have and standout insights from the writing questions? Any kind of "moment of clarity" thinking?
* What can you do at Turing to both build/practice your grit and support the grittiness of those around you?
