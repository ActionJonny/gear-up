# Badass Developers

## Plan

* 25 Minutes: Video
* 8 Minutes: Work on the writing questions below by yourself
* 8 Minutes: Follow the discussion plan with your small group

## Video

We're going to start with Kathy Sierra's keynote from [Fluent Conf 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSlRd6MnDv8).

You should take notes!

## Solo Writing

Write yourself a reflection guided by these questions:

* What products, especially software, do you use that make you feel most "badass"?
* We're talking about focusing on the user, and it sounds kind of obvious. Why *wouldn't* a developer or team focus on the user? What else might they be prioritizing?
* What about your own personal processes is dissipating your cognitive resources? Are there changes you could make so you have the energy to be "smarter" about your work? What would the downside be to making those choices?
* When you're working in a team, like a team here at Turing, how do you help your teammates feel like they're badass?
* After you're done here, what do you want to do? What kind of badass users do you want to create? Why?

## Group Discussion

In your small group get together and discuss the questions you just wrote about. What surprises you about your groupmates answers?
