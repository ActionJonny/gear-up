* What products, especially software, do you use that make you feel most "badass"?
* We're talking about focusing on the user, and it sounds kind of obvious. Why *wouldn't* a developer or team focus on the user? What else might they be prioritizing?
* What about your own personal processes is dissipating your cognitive resources? Are there changes you could make so you have the energy to be "smarter" about your work? What would the downside be to making those choices?
* When you're working in a team, like a team here at Turing, how do you help your teammates feel like they're badass?
* After you're done here, what do you want to do? What kind of badass users do you want to create? Why?
