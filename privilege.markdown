# Privilege

## Background (2 minutes)

Privilege refers to the advantages that individuals and groups are afforded in systems of power (communities, organizations, countries, families, etc.). Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw is an civil rights advocate and scholar who has introduced the term, "intersectionality," to refer to how individuals multiple identities intersect to create a composite experience of privilege. This means that an individual can experience privilege around some aspects of identity (ex: language, nationality, gender) while simultaneously facing marginalization for other aspects (ex: education-level, race, income-level).

While the concept of privilege can be a very charged topic for community discussion, we are making space to discuss it today for two reasons:

1.  To create an inclusive, diverse community at Turing, all members of the community need to be literate about privilege. Power, privilege, and marginalization are elephants in the room in the tech industry, and we will all need to discuss these dynamics intelligently if we hope to create an industry that is more inclusive and diverse.

2. Privilege is actually a dynamic around which members of our community can build and practice empathy. Given the lens of intersectionality, it's possible to explore similarities and differences in individual experience in a way that makes us more connected to each other.

In today's exercise, we will explore our own experiences with privilege and relate them to each others'.

## Setup

Chairs and tables available for small group discussions


## Privilege Statements (10 min)

Students should be seated with a notebook marked with two columns, "step forward" and "step backward".

*   The facilitor will read statements aloud. If the statement applies to you, add a check mark in the appropriate column per instructions.
*   The facilitator reads the statements below aloud, pausing slightly after each one.
*   When you have finished the statements, ask participants to submit their tally (step forward marks minus step backward marks).
*   Have everyone gather into a circle for debriefing and discussion.

## Debrief

The debrief gives participants an opportunity to process the emotions that surface during the activity and connect in empathy with each other. The debrief also helps participants realize the role that privilege plays in their lives and how it is integral to identity and experience. "Instead of casting off either privilege or marginalization, participants can learn how to reconcile with themselves, and through the utilization of newfound knowledge of the self, have a better relationship with themselves and others around them."

### Writing (10 min)

In your notebooks, reflect on the following question.

*   What was your experience when you learned where you fell in the spectrum of privilege across your classmates? How did that feel?
*   What were some factors that you have never thought of before?
*   What question made you think most? If you could add a question, what would it be?
*   What do you wish people knew about one of the identities, situations, or disadvantages that caused you to take a step back?
*   How can your understanding of your privileges or marginalizations improve your existing relationships with yourself and others?

## Discussion (30 min)

In small groups, discuss, to the extent each individual is comfortable, the reflections that came up in your writing. Make sure to discuss the final question and reflect on how this exercise and your experience of privilege and marginalization affects your ability to connect with other students.

(activity structure taken from PeaceLearner's [Privilege Walk Lesson Plan](https://peacelearner.org/2016/03/14/privilege-walk-lesson-plan/))

## Background (2 minutes)

A privilege walk is an experiential activity that illustrates how people benefit from and/or are marginalized by systems of power in our communities. The content of this activity highlights specifically the intersectionality of privilege: the idea that when we discuss privilege and oppression, we must consider the full context in which individuals experience power in the multiple communities of which they are a part.

The privilege walk, with its accompanying debrief, is often a less confrontational way to discuss privilege and reflect on its role in our community. It helps individuals relate to each other in a different way, and connect with empathy around shared experiences of privilege.

## Setup

*   An open space should be created in the classroom, with chairs and tables pushed back.
*   Chairs and tables available for small group discussions during debrief
*   Painters tape to define starting line for participants


## The Walk (10 min)

Have participants line up in a straight line across the middle of the room with plenty of space to move forward and backward as the exercise proceeds. The facilitator will share some background about the exercise and what to expect.

*   The facilitor will read statements aloud. If the statement applies to you, take a step forward. If you do not feel comfortable acknowledging a statement that applies to you, simply do not move when it is read.
*   The facilitator reads the statements below aloud, pausing slightly after each one.
*   When you have finished the statements, ask participants to take note of where they are in the room in relation to others.
*   Have everyone gather into a circle for debriefing and discussion.

## Debrief

The debrief gives participants an opportunity to release and process powerful emotions that surface during the activity. As students process the emotions that arise, the debrief also helps participants realize the role that privilege plays in their lives and how it is integral to identity and experience. "Instead of casting off either privilege or marginalization, participants can learn how to reconcile with themselves, and through the utilization of newfound knowledge of the self, have a better relationship with themselves and others around them."

### Writing (10 min)

In your notebooks, reflect on the following question.

*   What did you feel like being in the front of the group? In the back? In the middle?
*   What were some factors that you have never thought of before?
*   What question made you think most? If you could add a question, what would it be?
*   What do you wish people knew about one of the identities, situations, or disadvantages that caused you to take a step back?
*   How can your understanding of your privileges or marginalizations improve your existing relationships with yourself and others?

## Discussion (30 min)

In small groups, discuss, to the extent each individual is comfortable, the reflections that came up in your writing. Make sure to discuss the final question and reflect on how this exercise and your experience of privilege and marginalization will shape your ability to contribute to the Turing community.
