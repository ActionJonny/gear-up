# Privilege

Today we're going to talk a bit about gender and race, particularly in America,
and how they affect our life experiences.

## Structure

Please break up into your assigned groups and:

* Spend the first 12-14 minutes reading the article
* Spend 12-14 minutes writing notes in response to the questions
* Spend 14 minutes discussing your answers with your group
* Get back together for a quick full-group discussion

## Reading - 12 Minutes

[Peggy McIntosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peggy_McIntosh) is an activist and associate director of the Wellesley Centers for Women. Read your paper copy of her 1988 essay "WHITE PRIVILEGE AND MALE PRIVILEGE: A Personal Account of Coming to See
Correspondences Through Work in Women's Studies". For future reference the article is available [here](http://www.collegeart.org/pdf/diversity/white-privilege-and-male-privilege.pdf).

## Personal Processing - 12 Minutes

1. What's one way or incident where your gender has helped you? IE, what's a
situation where you may have had a worse outcome were you another gender? How
did you recognize gender as playing a role in the situation?
2. What's one situation where you've noticed someone else's race play a
significant part in the way they were treated, handled, or reacted to? How did
you know race was a factor? How did that make you feel?
3. Have you ever, in any situation or period of time, thought that things would
be easier, safer, or more successful if you were a different race or gender? Why?
4. Have you ever felt you were discriminated against? Maybe based on race or
gender, but consider more broadly sexuality, education, socio-economic status, age, religion, physical ability, etc. How did you know? Is it something that
affected you in a meaningful way, or were you able to brush it off?
5. When's the last time you found yourself pre-judging a person based on their
race, gender, or other perceptions? How did you deal with it?

## Group Discussion - 14 Minutes

Now get together with your group and consider the following:

* this is not a contest
* our own experience in singular and unique
* we discuss to empathize and understand, not prove wrong or right
* we listen not just waiting for an opportunity to talk, but as an opportunity
to imagine someone else's reality -- a world we have never and can never experience

With that context, work through sharing and discussing the Personal Processing
questions. Feel free to skip around as some of the later questions might be the
most thought provoking. If a person sharing their thoughts is willing, ask
probing questions to dig deep below the surface.

## Full Group - All Time Remaining

We'll get together as a full group and I'll ask a few students to share some
of the thoughts and experiences that they *heard from others in their group.*
