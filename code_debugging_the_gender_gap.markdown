## Gear Up - The Gender Gap in Technology

### Reflection (15 minutes)

Write a response to the following questions. This reflection is for you and no one else will be reading it.

* In your opinion, why are there so few women in technology?
* How have you experienced the underrepresentation of women in technology?

### Code: Debugging The Gender Gap (90 minutes)

We'll watch a documentary called _Code: Debugging the Gender Gap_ in the Big Workspace. You can find the trailer [here](http://www.codedoc.co/about/).

### Break (10 minutes)

### Introduction to Debrief Session (5 minutes)

In order to debrief the movie, we're going to break into small groups. You'll have the choice to join whatever group you feel most connected to at the moment. During our small group discussion, we want everyone to keep in mind the following:

* We aknowledge that there are many other underrepresented identities in technology, but we're being explicit but not exlusive about framing this conversation about the gender gap in technology.
* Assume best intent.
* No devil's advocate's. We want to have a meaningful conversation around the screening, not point out edge cases or "what if's".
* Let's practice our Active Listening skills.
* Keep the idea of "intent vs impact" in mind. We often judge ourselves by our intent and others by their impact (partly because we can't read their minds and know their true intent). If you say or do something that makes another person feel a certain way, you are responsible for the impact of your behavior regardless of what your intent was. 

The four groups we'd like you to choose from are the following:

1) I want to be conscientious about gender issues. What can I do? 

2) Iâ€™ve lived experiences like those referenced in the movie and want to share. 

3) I disagree with the framing of the movie. Why are we even talking about this at a programming school?

4) I want to take action on this at Turing. What can I do?

### Reflection Writing (10 minutes)

Write about your reaction the movie. Possible questions to keep in mind (if you can't think of anything to write about):

* What did you learn? 
* What did you already know? 
* What surprised you the most? 
* What do you agree/disagree with?

### Small Group Discussion (40 minutes)

More to come.

### Wrap-Up (10 minutes)

Each group shares key takeaways from small group discussion.
