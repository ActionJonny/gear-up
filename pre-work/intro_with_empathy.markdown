## Turing Culture: Diversity, Inclusion, and Professionalism
_Our mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers._

### Premises
* Interpersonal skills have a direct, significant impact on your professional success.
* Interpersonal skills are comprised of internal-facing abilities (self-awareness, self-regulation, empathy) and external-facing abilities (communication, active listening, compassion)
* Interpersonal skills can be developed and improved.
* To "train students for high-fulfillment technical careers," Turing has a responsibility to expose students to and help them develop interpersonal skills.

### Supporting Inclusion and Professional Success
* Direct Programming: sessions and activities with singular focus on interpersonal skills.
  * Gear Up
  * Professional Development
  * PROtocol Sessions
* Indirect Programming: sessions and activities in which interpersonal skills are critical, but not sole focus.
  * Pair and team project work, assessment, and reflections
  * etc.

### Pre-Work Preparation
Empathy is a crucial internal-facing skill that will affect your ability to be successful as a student at Turing and as a professional programmer after you graduate.
