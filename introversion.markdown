# Introversion and Extroversion on Teams

## Watch (20 min)
Watch this TED talk by Susan Cain, author of _Quiet: The Power of Introverts_. If you'd like to watch it alone with headphones, feel free to relocate to another classroom to do so. 

## Read (10 min)
Read this _Harvard Business Review_ article, ["Introverts, Extroverts, and the Complexities of Team Dynamics."](https://hbr.org/2015/03/introverts-extroverts-and-the-complexities-of-team-dynamics) (Francesca Gino: March 16, 2015).

## Reflect (15 min)
Cain and Gino both suggest that the world is designed in a way that favors extroverts. In spite of our field being more inviting to introverts than others, we still practice many habits around meeting, project, and professional development protocols that favor extroverted over introverted style. 

You already have opportunities to make your projects and Turing activities more hospitable to introverted personalities. Use the following questions to investigate these opportunities more deeply and identify strategies for reshaping them. Write your answers in a [new gist](https://gist.github.com/).

* Have you ever been in a team setting where the differences between introverted and extroverted working styles was clear. What was that like?
* How do you think you’re perceived by the other personality type?
* What advice do you have for people on the other end of the introverted/extroverted spectrum, in terms of making work routines productive for your style?
* Do you think our default approaches to group activities at Turing are sufficiently accommodating to introverted personalities? Reflect on how we could reshape team and group activities (pairings, team retros, cohort retros) to create an environment in which introverts’ and extroverts strengths are equally supported.  

## Discuss (10 min)
Convene with your most recent project pair or team and share your reactions to the questions above. If you’re in just a pair, join forces with another pair to create a group of 4. 

Sit with your groups in your assigned locations. Make sure to assign someone in your group the role of timekeeper, facilitator, and listening monitor to remind everyone to practice active listening. Take collective responsibility for all members having a chance to share their perspectives and learn from others.

As you go through each question, do a **reaction round** where each person talks for 30 seconds on the topic. You should allocate approximately 2.5 minutes for each question.
