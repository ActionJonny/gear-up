# Introversion and Extroversion on Teams

## Watch (20 min)
Watch this TED talk by Susan Cain, author of _Quiet: The Power of Introverts_. If you'd like to watch it alone with headphones, feel free to relocate to another classroom to do so. 

## Read (10 min)
Read this _Harvard Business Review_ article, ["Introverts, Extroverts, and the Complexities of Team Dynamics."](https://hbr.org/2015/03/introverts-extroverts-and-the-complexities-of-team-dynamics) (Francesca Gino: March 16, 2015).

## Reflect (15 min)
Cain and Gino both suggest that the world is designed in a way that favors extroverts. In spite of our field being more inviting to introverts than others, we still practice many habits around meeting, project, and professional development protocols that favor extroverted over introverted style. 

You already have opportunities to make your projects and Turing activities more hospitable to introverted personalities. Use the following questions to investigate these opportunities more deeply and identify strategies for reshaping them. Write your answers in a [new gist](https://gist.github.com/).

* How could you shape your DTR conversations with new project partners to accommodate their styles from the beginning? Explain why your proposed approach would be more accommodating. 
* When problems arise on projects, teammembers are often required to speak up and confront their partner or a larger group of teammembers. Describe a new team routine (ex: an evening survey or standup) that you could put in place that would allow these issues to surface without require teammembers to begin a heated, confrontational, in-person conversation. 
* Do you think your default approach to teamwork is sufficiently accommodating to introverted personalities. How could you change your new dynamics to allow people to work more independently or quietly?
* Creating more opportunities for people on your team to work independently is not without cost. Your work becomes more vulnerable to miscommunications and redundancies. Imagine a time (at Turing our before your time here) in which delegation of responsibilities was effectively managed. What about your team dynamic allowed the delegation to be successful?

## Share and Provide Feedback (10 min)
Slack your partner the link to your gist (pairs posted in Slack). When you receive theirs, read it closely and carefully. Identify at least one of each type of feedback listed here and respond to them in Slack.
* Identify one new strategy you found appealing and what you liked about it.
* Suggest one modification to their suggestions and why you think it would advance their goals more effectively.
* Compare your partner's example of effective delegation of responsibilities to your own example. How are they similar, how are the different?
