# Strengths: The Fallacy of the American Dream

After decades of researching personal happiness, workforce development, and management efficacy, Gallup, the research-based, global performance management consulting company, determined that individuals who have an opportunity to focus on their strengths are "six times more likely to be engaged in their jobs" and "three times as likely to report having an excellent quality of life in general." These findings prompted a whole industry of strengths-based professional development tools, foremost of which is Gallup's own StrengthsFinder 2.0, which was Amazon's bestselling book of 2013 and has sold over 4 million copies.”

While there are many frameworks for organizing personal and professional development, this strengths-based approach stands out as a tool.
