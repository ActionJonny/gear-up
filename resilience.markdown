# Resilience

## Introduction: Relationship to Turing Mission
*Our mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.*

Psychological resilience is the ability to experience potentially traumatic events and challenges and come through stronger, wiser, and more flexible. Research over the last 30 years has indicated individuals' ability to thrive  is less a matter of being spared challenges and personal difficulties; rather, it is shaped by how individuals respond to challenges -- whether they focus on how terrible the events are or view them as opportunities to grow.

While stressors can affect individuals' quality of life, researchers now understand there are *protective* factors that have almost as much (if not more) influence on how challenging events shape peoples' lives. The *skill* of resilience is one of those factors.

In order to advance Turing's mission, it's important to help students develop resilience. We regularly hear from employers that they value employees that are hungry to learn new skills, communicate effectively, and work well on teams. This work is emotionally demanding and draining. In order to position our students to be successful during their time at Turing and in their career afterwards, they must have skills to weather the personal and professional stressors they'll encounter so they can sustain high levels of performance in these areas. 

Given Turing's commitment to advancing diversity in the field, resilience will also help students manage the stress and emotional demands of advancing diversity and inclusion in difficult conversations and environments.

Read the *New Yorker* and *Inc* articles below. Pay attention to how the authors discuss 1) the connection between individuals' mindsets and resilience, and 2) how resilience is a *skill*.

## Write (10 min)
Get your notebooks out and reflect on the following questions. 
* When you first read the title of this GearUp, what were your initial reactions? What experiences have you had that shaped your attitude toward the topic?
* What did you learn from reading the article? Did this change or affirm any attitudes and beliefs you hold?
* What value do you put on personal resilience? Why?
* How would you describe your resilience right now? Why?

## Discuss (25 min)
Before you begin discussing this topic, ensure that the following roles are delegated to members of your group.

**Timekeeper**: Ensure that the group has a chance to address all the discussion questions and time at the end to complete the survey.  

**Facilitator**: Works with the timekeeper to move through the discussion questions. Solicits input from all members of the group and helps individuals be aware if they are dominating the conversation.  

**Participant (all)**: Listens actively, is respectful and engaged, takes responsibility for all members having a chance to share their perspectives and learn from others.

As a group, discuss the following questions:
* What level of value do you place on resilience? Why is this important to you (or not)?
* As a Turing community, why is resilience something we would want to support and nurture in our students and staff? How does it support our mission
* How will resilience affect your career as a programmer? Why would employers value employee resilience?
* What can you do to practice resilience?
* How can we support each other develop resilience at Turing?
