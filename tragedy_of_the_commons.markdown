#Tragedy of the Commons: Voting, Sustainability, Cleaning

We are confronted on a daily basis by social challenges -- ineffective public leaders, global warming, a sink full of dirty dishes -- for which we, as individuals, bear some small responsibility. It's often difficult for us to see the connection between small choices we make and large systemic issues. And when we are able to make the connection, it's not always obvious how we can best take responsibility for our actions. 

Today, we will explore this quandary in more depth, and use our discussions around this topic as a forum for strengthening skills that can help us more meaningfully participate in our communities in the future. These skills include:
* Effectively communicating a contrary opinion
* Facilitating and holding space for controversial conversations
* Defining personal opinions and their relationship to others'

##Exploring (10 min)
Read and interact with [Parable of the Polygons: A Playable Post on the Shape of Society](http://ncase.me/polygons/). Make sure you understand how the creators arrived at the dynamics they summarize at the end.  
  1. Small individual shortcomings lead to large collective failures.  
  2. Systemic issues from the past are unlikely to be remedied by neutral responses in the present.  
  3. Small individual "anti-biases" can address systemic biases.

* What individual actions, or lack thereof, contribute to the issue
* What would taking individual responsibility for this issue look like?
* While it may be reasonable to change your individual behavior to positively impact this issue, it becomes more complicated when you consider that there are dozens (if not hundreds) of similar causes vying for our attention. What do you think is the most realistic, responsible response to the inundation of these ethical demands?
