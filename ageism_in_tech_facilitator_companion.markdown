### Discussion (10 min)
Discuss the question “How are institutions shaped by individual actions?” through the lens of ageism in the tech industry.  

_It may be helpful to do a quick_ *vocabular review* _here: What is an institution? (a company, an industry, a subset of an industry, a social convention, i.e. marriage) and What do we mean by individual actions? (interactions, choices you make in your day to do life)_  

*Assign a timekeeper* and a *notetaker*. _It is_ *strongly* _encouraged that you take notes on a white-board or big post-it -- these props help your group process the discussion and internalize takeaways._  

* *According to the articles and your own experiences, what institutional norms and practices perpetuate ageism?*  
_(possibilities here include default social activities, work hours, recreational activities, style of meetings, communication style)_  
* *Identify three scenarios in which you are likely to encounter these institutional norms and practices in your first 3 years of employment in the tech industry?*  
_It's best for these to come organically, but if you're desperate for ideas, here are some examples: interviewing candidates and your company has a bias for experiences young people are more likely to have, ageism excluded from your company's diversity efforts despite their clear lack of age diversity)_
* *How do you expect you will you be affected by these norms and practices? Will you benefit or suffer from them?*  
* *Pick the scenario that’s most interesting to your group. Brainstorm three ways of responding to the situation. Then answer the question for each: if everyone in your position responded to this situation the same way, what impact would that have on the tech industry as a whole?*  
* *What type of action in this situation is most consistent with your values and feels authentic?*  
_This may be a good question to let people reflect and write on quietly in your themselves._ 

### Recap (5 min)
_The goal of recap is to synthesize the topics you've discussed. Consider reading through what your notetaker captured from your discussion. If you gave your group time to reflect privately on the last topic, this may be a good time for everyone to report out their ideas._

### Complete Surveys (5 min)
_The facilitator is responsible for everyone in their group filling out surveys. Make time for it -- even if it means cutting the discussion short. Two reasons the survey is important: 1) It will give you some information about how your group management was perceived by the group, and 2) It will help set a tone of reverence for mod 1-3 student toward GearUp as a whole -- a small legacy you can leave behind.
