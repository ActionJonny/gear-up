## Ageism: A Lens for Exploring Diversity and Individual Action

Last Gear Up, we read some articles about ageism in the tech space and explored how we individually relate to the issue. This week, we will tackle ageism through an organizational leadership lens. 

In the scenario below, you and your team are tasked with addressing a cultural issue that's surfaced among the young developers in your company and is beginning to threaten your business's profitability. Your group will need to develop recommendations that balance your responsibilities to your investors, your clients, and your employees. 

### Introductions (5 min)

### Review the Scenario (5 min)
> Your Gen-Y company was just acquired by a larger company, and one of your teams was put on a project for AARP. A month into the project, issues started to surface related to members of your team struggling to relate to the customer’s needs. The issue culminated in an disastrous meeting with your client in which one of your team members was dismissive of some of the needs your client raised. The client later contacted your CEO and threatened to leave unless the tone of your meetings changed and your team was more aligned with their overall goals.

> You quickly become aware that this disdain for the AARP project is epidemic among your team. You’re able to replace the team lead with a gentleman in his early-50s from your parent company, and while this subdues your client in the short-term, it’s now beginning to cause strife between the lead and the rest of your team.

> While the youthful culture of your developers was celebrated before the acquisition, it is now a liability. If you aren’t able to turn things around quickly, you’ll probably be forced to fire some of your employees or they’ll leave by themselves. You assemble a team of people who were at your start-up from the beginning, care about the employees involved, and care about the success of the acquisition to develop some recommendations on how to de-escalate the situation.
