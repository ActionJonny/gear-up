## Ageism: A Lens for Exploring Diversity and Organizational Leadership

Last Gear Up, we read about ageism in the tech space and explored how we individually relate to the issue. This week, we will tackle ageism through an organizational leadership lens. 

In the scenario below, you and your team are tasked with addressing a cultural issue that's surfaced among the young developers in your company and is beginning to threaten your business's profitability. Your group will need to develop recommendations that balance your responsibilities to your investors, your clients, and your employees. 

### Introductions (5 min)

### Scenario (5 min)
With your team, review the scenario below.  

> Your Gen-Y company was just acquired by a larger company, and several of your developers have been moved over to the parent company's project for AARP. Early into the project, your developers inability to relate to the expectations of your client and their customers began to undermine their ability to meet the client's needs. The issue culminated in an disastrous meeting with your client in which one of your engineers was dismissive of the needs your client raised. Your engineer wasn't trying to be combative, but his lack of understanding for older customer's needs and relationships with tech nevertheless came across as impatient and unaccommodating. The client later contacted your CEO and threatened to leave unless the tone of your meetings changed and your team was more aligned with their overall goals.

> You quickly become aware that this disdain for the AARP project is epidemic among your team. Many of your developers are unenthusiastic about adapting to clients needs, and they seem unable to imagine creative solutions to some of the challenges the project poses. You’re able to replace the team lead with a gentleman in his early-50s from your parent company, and while this subdues your client in the short-term, it’s now beginning to cause strife between the lead and the rest of your team. 

> While the youthful culture of your developers was celebrated before the acquisition, it is now a liability. If you aren’t able to turn things around quickly, either your client will leave, or you'll be forced to take some dramatic actions with your employees that may harm the otherwise creative and dynamic environment you worked so hard to create. You assemble a team of people who were at your start-up from the beginning, care about the employees involved, and care about the success of the acquisition to develop some recommendations on how to de-escalate the situation.

Together, you will serve as an advisory board tasked with developing recommendations for your company's CEO.
