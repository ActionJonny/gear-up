#Session 1  *Align to Gear up Goals

###Facilitator Set Up:
* Put students in groups of 4-5 maximum
* Pull up the Gear Up Markdown that students will be updating 
* Pull up the survey feedback from the last time the session was facilitated

##Framing (5 min)

In Mod 4, we want you to round out your Gear Up experience and continue to develop skills that could be beneficial to you in the future.  In this module, you are going to review a past Gear Up session and make improvements to it in order to ensure that we are continuing to build towards our mission.  In Gear Up Sessions on weeks 1 and 3, you will spend time reviewing feedback and making updates to a past session.   In week 5, we want to encourage you to faciliate a small group session or participate in the newly designed session to experience the improvements.  We will take you step by step through this process.
